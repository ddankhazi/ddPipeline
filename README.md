# ddPipeline
My own home Maya/Arnold “pipeline” if you can call it that. :)

Install: 
Just put this ddPipeline.mel script file into your */Documents/maya/*MayaVersion*/Scripts/ folder.

Also copy the icons folder into your */Documents/maya/*MayaVersion*/scripts folder.

Use this mel command to to open the tool: 
rehash; source "ddPipeline.mel";

You can create a shelf button for it.
