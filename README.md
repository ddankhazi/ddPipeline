# ddPipeline
My own home Maya/Arnold “pipeline” if you can call to that. :)

Install: 
Just put this ddPipeline.mel script file into your */Documents/maya/*versionOfMaya*/Scripts folder.
Use this mel command to to open the tool: 
rehash; source "ddPipeline.mel";

You can create a shelf button for it.
